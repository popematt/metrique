/// The Amazon [Embedded Metric Format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Embedded_Metric_Format_Specification.html).
///
/// EMF is a format that allows for emitting CloudWatch Metrics from specially-formatted JSON CloudWatch Logs log events.
/// To emit the metrics, you just need to emit the log lines created by this struct into some CloudWatch Logs Log Stream
/// in your AWS account, no extra configuration needed. Most users would pipe the logs to a rotating file then use
/// [CloudWatch Agent] to upload the logs, but any way of calling [PutLogEvents] will work.
///
/// EMF requires there to be a timestamp in metrics. If your entry has an `#[entry(timestamp)]` field,
/// (or if you call [`EntryWriter::timestamp()`](metrique_writer::EntryWriter::timestamp) directly), that will
/// be used as the timestamp. Otherwise, a timestamp will be generated from [`SystemTime::now`] when
/// [`format`] is called.
///
/// [`SystemTime::now`]: std::time::SystemTime::now
/// [`format`]: [Emf::format]
///
/// EMF publishes metrics under a namespace and dimension-set, which you must pass to your builder as parameters.
///
/// ## Dimensions
///
/// This formatter creates a single EMF directive, which only has a single dimension-set. Therefore, if metrics are passed with metric-specific dimensions,
/// for example via [WithDimension](metrique_writer::value::WithDimension), there are currently 3 options:
/// 1. An error will occur (this is the default).
/// 2. If [`allow_ignored_dimensions`](EmfBuilder::allow_ignored_dimensions) is used, the metric will be emitted without the extra dimensions,
///    with just the `default_dimensions`.
/// 3. If the `AllowSplitEntries` config is enabled, there will be a separate entry
///    generated for each set of dimension values. This is generally the right thing to
///    do when emitting time-based metrics as it will cause them to be emitted correctly, but
///    the wrong thing to do when emitting wide events.
///
/// In a future version, there might be additional options.
///
/// If you want to emit metrics with specific dimensions, you can add additional directives using the [`directive`](EmfBuilder::directive)
/// function. EMF ignores missing metrics and missing dimensions in dimension-sets, so if you emit a metric only
/// under specific conditions there is no problem with having the directive.
///
/// If you want to declare dimension sets where some dimensions may not be present in every
/// entry, use [`allow_dimensions_with_no_data`](EmfBuilder::allow_dimensions_with_no_data) to suppress the missing-dimension
/// error.
///
/// ## Metric emission format - scalar vs. histogram
///
/// The EMF formatter can emit metrics in 2 different forms:
///
/// 1. The traditional, "scalar" metrics. For example `{ "_aws": {...}, "MyMetric": 2 }`
/// 2. "Histogram" metrics. For example
///    `{ "_aws": {...}, "MyMetric": { "Values": [0.01, 0.17], "Counts": [10, 20] } }`,
///    which emits the `0.01` data point with multiplicity 10 and `0.17` data point with multiplicity 20.
///
/// The "histogram" form allows for emitting metrics with a large `Count` using O(1) cost. It is used
/// Therefore, it is used when there are multiple [`Observation`]s for a single metric, an
/// [`Observation::Repeated`], or [sampling].
///
/// CloudWatch EMF and CloudWatch Metrics support both forms equally well and "native" CloudWatch Metrics
/// statistics like sums, averages, and percentiles will work the same in both forms, with no extra
/// setup needed.
///
/// However, other tools that process the emitted logs, including [CloudWatch Logs Insights] queries as well as
/// any custom tooling that processes the log JSONs must to be adapted to support the format that
/// is being emitted.
///
/// [sampling]: Emf::with_sampling
/// [CloudWatch Logs Insights]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html
///
/// ## Handling of non-finite floating-point values
///
/// Floating-point infinities are clamped (replaced with +f64::MAX or -f64::MAX).
///
/// NaN observations are skipped. If a metric has only NaN observations, it will be skipped.
/// In these cases, a rate-limited [`tracing`] error will be generated.
///
/// All observations other than the ones containing the NaN will be emitted as usual.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// Here is an example of using [`Emf`] to format an [`Entry`] as a string:
///
/// ```
/// # use metrique_writer::{
/// #    Entry, EntryWriter,
/// #    format::{Format as _},
/// # };
/// # use metrique_writer_format_emf::Emf;
/// # use std::time::{Duration, SystemTime};

///     #[entry(timestamp)]
///     start: SystemTime,
///     my_field: u32,
/// }
///
/// let mut emf = Emf::all_validations("MyApp".to_string(), vec![vec![]]);
/// let mut output = Vec::new();
///
/// emf.format(&MyMetrics {
///     start: SystemTime::UNIX_EPOCH, // use SystemTime::now() in the real world
///     my_field: 4,
/// }, &mut output).unwrap();
///
/// let output = String::from_utf8(output).unwrap();
/// assert_json_diff::assert_json_eq!(serde_json::from_str::<serde_json::Value>(&output).unwrap(),

    /// Wrap the given `Emf` with support for sampling with the default RNG.

    /// [`sample_by_congress_at_fixed_entries_per_second`] or [`sample_by_fixed_fraction`]
    /// to give every [`Entry`] emission event a "sample rate", and only emit the
    /// [`Entry`] with that probability (and drop it otherwise). The more sophisticated
    /// sampling implementations vary the sample rate to ensure that a rate limit is
    /// not significantly exceeded and that rare events (for example, error entries) remain
    /// sampled.
    ///
    /// To ensure that aggregate statistics (for example, sums or averages) of sampled
    /// metrics remain accurate, especially with per-metric sample rates, every metric
    /// that is "successfully" sampled is counted with a "weight" that is equivalent to
    /// the inverse of its rate. For example, if the sample rate of an entry is 0.5,
    /// a "successfully" sampled entry is supposed to count with a "weight" of 2.
    /// If the sample rate is 0.01, the sampled entry will count with a "weight" of 100.
    ///
    /// The way this weighting is done in the EMF formatter is by making each metric count as
    /// **duplicate datapoints**.
    ///
    /// ### Integer Multiplicity (and the RNG)
    ///
    /// Since in CloudWatch, the multiplicity of a datapoint is required to be an integer,
    /// the EMF emitter will randomly pick between either the floor or the
    /// ceiling of the inverse rate with the right probability to ensure the statistics are
    /// unbiased.
    ///
    /// For example, if a metric with a sample rate of 0.3 is sampled, it will be emitted with a
    /// multiplicity of 3 with probability 2/3 and multiplicity of 4 with probability 1/3,
    /// which leads to the following distribution:
    ///
    ///  - 70% - metric is not sampled
    ///  - 30% - metric is sampled
    ///    - 20% - metric is sampled with multiplicity 3
    ///    - 10% - metric is sampled with multiplicity 4
    ///
    /// And as you can see, the expected multiplicity is `0.2 * 3 + 0.1 * 4 = 1`, which ensures
    /// there is no bias.
    ///
    /// The RNG that is picked here (in this function to be the [ThreadRng], or the caller-specified
    /// RNG passed in [`with_sampling_and_rng`]) is solely used to pick the integer multiplicity.
    /// The actual "sampling" RNG used to pick which entries are sampled is a part of the sampler
    /// implementation - to customize it, you would need to for example use
    /// [`CongressSampleBuilder::build_with_rng`].
    ///
    /// Of course, if you want determinism (for example, for testing), you need to pass both RNGs,
    /// and of course, the precise way random numbers are selected is not stable between different
    /// versions of this crate.
    ///
    /// ### Metric Emission Format
    ///
    /// Using `with_sampling` will make all metrics be emitted in the histogram format (even if the
    /// sampling rate is 1). CloudWatch Metrics will handle the histogram format just fine, but
    /// you should make sure that any queries (using [CloudWatch Logs Insights]
